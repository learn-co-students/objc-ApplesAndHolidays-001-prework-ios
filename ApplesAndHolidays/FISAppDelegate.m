/* TASK
 Look at the HolidayTests file to review the structure of the suppliesByHolidayAndSeason dictionary at the top of the file. This dictionary is submitted to the database argument of the method calls across the test file, meaning that it's the collection you'll be working with. You should be able to decipher that this is a nested collection: the first layer is a static dictionary of "season" keys; each season key is bound to a mutable dictionary of "holiday" keys; each holiday key is bound to mutable array of "supplies" relevant to that holiday.
